# My C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ study repository!

This project serves as a living document of my progress as I master the fundamentals and advanced concepts of **C++**.

I am documenting my entire learning path here through code examples, notes, and basic projects. This Journey started on **December 19th 2026**. Whereas this repository has been created on **January 25th 2026**.

> **Note:** While this repo contains my daily studies and small projects, all current and future larger-scale applications will be hosted in their own dedicated repositories. So please take a look at my profile!

## What I’ve Covered So Far

### 1. Vectors & Data Manipulation (`vectorStuff.cpp`)
Explored the `std::vector` container and different ways to iterate through data:
* **Classic For-Loops:** Using indices `for(int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i)`.
* **Range-based For-Loops:** Modern C++ syntax `for(int a : vec)`.
* **Auto Keyword:** Utilizing `auto` for cleaner, type-safe iterations.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (`classStuff.cpp`)
Building the foundation of OOP with a focus on:
* **Constructors:** Implementing both default and parameterized constructors.
* **Encapsulation:** Managing access levels using `public` and `private` members.
* **Const Correctness:** Learning where, when, and why to use `const` to write safer, read-only code.

### 3. File I/O & Parsing
Practical application of data handling:
* **`std::ifstream`:** Opening and reading from `.txt` files.
* **Data Parsing:** Tokenizing strings from a file (like a student list) and converting them into class objects.

## Tools & Environment
* **Language:** C++17 / C++20
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Build System:** MSBuild (.sln / .vcxproj)
